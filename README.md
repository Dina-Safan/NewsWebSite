# 📰 News Website Project

This is a simple responsive news website built using **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript**.  
It uses the **NewsAPI** to fetch the latest headlines dynamically based on two filters:
- 🌍 **Country selection** (United States, Egypt, Japan, France, etc.)
- 🗂️ **Category selection** (Business, Sports, Health, General, Entertainment, Technology, Science)

Users can easily switch between countries and categories to view the latest articles.  
If no news is found, a custom “Not Found” illustration is displayed.
